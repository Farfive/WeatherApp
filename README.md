# WeatherApp

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

WeatherApp is a Kotlin-based Android application built using the Jetpack Compose UI toolkit, Retrofit for networking, and follows the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architectural pattern. The app allows users to get real-time weather information for a specific location.

## Features

- Get current weather information for a specific location.
- Display weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
- Search for weather information by city name or location coordinates.
- Dark mode support for better visibility in low-light conditions.
- Automatic location detection to fetch weather information for the user's current location.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The application is developed using the Kotlin programming language, known for its concise syntax and strong type safety.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Jetpack Compose is used for building the user interface, providing a declarative and modern approach to UI development.
- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is used for making network requests to the weather API and handling JSON parsing.
- **Model-View-Intent (MVI)**: The app follows the MVI architectural pattern, which separates the logic for data handling and UI presentation, providing a clean and reactive code structure.
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependency injection frameworks like Dagger or Koin can be used for managing dependencies within the application.
